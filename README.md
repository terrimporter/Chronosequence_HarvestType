# README

This repository contains the supplementary digital resources, scripts, and files used in the paper Porter et al., 2024 "Soil bacteria, fungi, and arthropod communities following full tree clearcut and salvage harvest have different early successional dynamics compared with post-wildfire patterns."

## Digital Resources

The code for the MetaWorks bioinformatic pipeline that we developed to process multi-marker metabarcoding data is available from https://github.com/terrimporter/MetaWorks, installation and usage instructions are available here https://terrimporter.github.io/MetaWorksSite/, and our publication is https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0274260 .  

The following curated and trained naive Bayesian classifiers are available from:  
  ITS - https://github.com/terrimporter/UNITE_ITSClassifier, the original UNITE reference set is available from https://unite.ut.ee/repository.php  
  COI - https://github.com/terrimporter/CO1Classifier (our publication is here https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22505-4)  
  16S - comes with the Ribosomal Database Project Naive Bayesian Classifier, the original code for this is available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/rdp-classifier/
